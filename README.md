Waterloo Enghack project and professional website that displays municipal voter information.

# How to read the display
Every color represents the percentage of voters per district over the number of voters registered for that district. 
If the percentage is above 70%, it means there is a high percentage of voters for that district.
If the percentage is between 20% and 70%, it means there is a medium percentage of voters for that district.
If the percentage is lower than 20%, it means that there is a critical percentage of voters for that district.

This website visualizes statistical data pulled from Waterloo's municipal data.
